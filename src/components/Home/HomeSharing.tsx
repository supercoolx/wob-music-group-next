                <span className="font-bold">How It Works:</span> Every month there will be royalties that will
                be paid out from the WL&apos;s music distributor into the community Solana wallet. Part of those
                royalties will be shared with various artists that helped to make the song and the remaining
                royalties are going to go back into the project so we can invest in the project in various ways
                with the number one goal being to benefit the WB Holders as much as possible.
