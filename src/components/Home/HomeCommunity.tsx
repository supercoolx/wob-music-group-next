                The remix for each song will be sourced from the community. MegaWob holders can submit
                their remix and the team will choose the top 3 submissions to be put on the website for
                a vote. The community will then have 72 hours to vote on the best remix and the one with
                the most votes will win and be the remix that we end up releasing.
