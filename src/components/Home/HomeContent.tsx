                For our song releases to do well we are going to need a consistent stream of content that
                feature the songs. That&apos;s where the community comes into play, we have one of the most
                creative communities and we want to source consistent content around each song release
                via fun and strategic contests. Any content that we end up choosing and using will win
                various prizes and have their content featured on the Wobblebug channels.
            </p><br />

                Winners will receive 25 $WOB for each piece of content they create that we pick.
